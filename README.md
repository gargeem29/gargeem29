- 👋 Hi, I’m Gargee!
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Development (But Frontend specifically hehe )
- 🌱 I’m currently in my 4th year at IIIT-Vadodara, India.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything that is difficult and exciting to code (afterall its the solving of bugs that matter!)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: The first computer "bug" was an actual bug! (I ChatGPTed it 😭)
- ✨ I also love to dance (like a lottt) and read books!
